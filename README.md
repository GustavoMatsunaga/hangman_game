# hangman_game
This is a HangMan Game created by Gustavo, using Python in the course of Allura. I've incremented some restraints in the input of the user to make the game better.
After the download you need to put both of, the game and the TXT, on the same directory to run the aplication.
It's a fun game.
It was made by guessing fruits, but you can change the TXT and make it for other types of things.
